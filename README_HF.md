# GenesisX - Advanced Ecosystem Simulator

An AI-powered ecosystem simulation featuring autonomous agents with large language model reasoning capabilities.

## Features

- **TIME_V1 System**: Biologically accurate time progression (1 hour per step)
- **CausalAgents**: LLM-powered autonomous agents with reasoning capabilities
- **Observer Analytics**: Real-time epidemiology tracking and mass balance validation
- **High-Performance**: Optimized for GPU-accelerated environments

## Hardware Requirements

This simulation is designed to run on high-performance hardware:
- **GPUs**: 4x L40S (recommended)
- **RAM**: 382GB (recommended for large-scale simulations)
