## 🚀 How to Proceed

### Immediate Next Steps

1. **Verify Prerequisites**
   ```powershell
   # Check Qt installation
   qmake --version
   
   # Check CMake
   cmake --version
   
   # Check compiler
   cl  # MSVC on Windows
   ```

2. **Build the Application**
   ```powershell
   cd qt-gui
   .\scripts\build.ps1 -BuildType Debug
   ```

3. **Run the Application**
   ```powershell
   .\build\bin\Debug\ecosysx-gui.exe
   ```

4. **Verify Basic Functionality**
   - Window opens with title "EcoSysX - Ecosystem Simulator"
   - File → Exit works
   - Help → About shows version info

### If Build Succeeds
✅ **Phase 1 is essentially complete!**
- Update PHASE_1_CHECKLIST.md
- Commit all work to repository
- Begin planning Sprint 1 (Foundations)

### If Build Fails
Refer to DEVELOPMENT_SETUP.md troubleshooting section:
- Verify Qt6 installation and PATH
- Check CMake configuration output
- Ensure compiler is properly configured

## 🎓 Key Decisions Made

1. **Build System**: CMake chosen for cross-platform compatibility
2. **Qt Version**: Qt 6.2+ as minimum, 6.5+ recommended
3. **C++ Standard**: C++17
4. **Project Structure**: Modular design with clear separation of concerns
5. **IPC Method**: JSON-RPC over stdio (with socket option)
6. **Threading**: UI thread + Worker thread for engine communication
7. **Documentation**: Markdown for easy version control and viewing

## 📝 Notes for Team

- All documentation is comprehensive and ready for team onboarding
- Build system is flexible and supports multiple generators (MSVC, MinGW, Unix Makefiles)
- Project structure supports future extensibility (plugins, additional panels)
- Coding standards align with Qt best practices
- Test infrastructure prepared but not fully implemented (Sprint 1 task)
