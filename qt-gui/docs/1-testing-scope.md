# Testing Scope Documentation

## What We're Testing

This document outlines the testing scope for the EcoSysX Qt GUI application.

### Core Components

#### 1. MainWindow
- Window initialization and layout
- Menu bar and toolbar functionality
- Docking widget management
- Status bar updates

#### 2. Engine Integration
- Engine initialization and lifecycle
- Command queue processing
- State synchronization
- Performance metrics collection

#### 3. Performance Monitoring
- Real-time metrics display
- FPS/frame time tracking
- Memory usage monitoring
- Agent count tracking

#### 4. UI Components
- Control panel widgets
- Settings dialogs
- Performance dashboard
- Log viewer

### Test Categories

#### Unit Tests
- Individual class methods
- Data structure operations
- Utility functions
- Isolated component behavior

#### Integration Tests
- Engine-GUI communication
- Signal-slot connections
- Multi-component interactions
- State management across modules

#### System Tests
- Full application lifecycle
- End-to-end workflows
- Performance under load
- Resource cleanup

### Test Coverage Goals

- **Core Engine Integration**: >90%
- **UI Components**: >80%
- **Utility Classes**: >85%
- **Overall Project**: >80%

### Critical Test Paths

1. **Application Startup**
   - Initialize engine
   - Create main window
   - Load default configuration
   - Display ready state

2. **Simulation Execution**
   - Start simulation
   - Process updates
   - Render frames
   - Display metrics
   - Handle pause/resume
   - Stop cleanly

3. **Performance Monitoring**
   - Collect metrics continuously
   - Update UI at 60 FPS
   - Handle metric spikes
   - Display warnings for degradation

4. **Resource Management**
   - Memory allocation/deallocation
   - GPU resource handling
   - Thread lifecycle
   - File I/O operations

### Testing Standards

- All new features must include tests
- Bug fixes must include regression tests
- Tests must pass before merging
- CI/CD must be green
- Coverage must not decrease

### Known Limitations

- Some GPU-specific tests require hardware
- UI tests may be platform-dependent
- Performance tests vary by system specs

### Future Testing Enhancements

- [ ] Add GPU compute shader tests
- [ ] Implement visual regression testing
- [ ] Add load testing framework
- [ ] Expand cross-platform test coverage
- [ ] Add automated performance benchmarks
