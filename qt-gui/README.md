## 1) Objectives and Non-Goals

### Objectives ‚úÖ
* Build a native desktop GUI that can start, run, step, snapshot, and stop the EcoSysX simulator while staying responsive under heavy loads
* Present live metrics, a 2D world view of agents, and controls for configuration
* Minimize coupling via JSON-RPC communication (stdio-based)
* Thread-safe architecture preventing UI blocking

### Non-Goals (Future Phases)
* 3D rendering (planned for Phase 3)
* Remote multi-client orchestration
* Direct algorithmic tuning of the simulator
* Built-in engine implementation (external process)

## 2) Stakeholders and Personas

* Primary: You (developer/researcher) running local simulations.
* Secondary: Collaborators who want a reproducible, shareable binary with presets.
* Tertiary: Future users who may wish to add new providers or visualizations.

## 3) High-Level Architecture

* Front-end: Qt Widgets application with dockable panels (Config, Metrics, World, Event Log).
* Back-end: Node process hosting `GenesisEngine` (the existing package). The Node sidecar receives JSON-RPC requests and returns responses line-delimited over stdio or via a localhost socket. The engine's API and snapshot structure are already defined in the repo (configuration, snapshot schema, and provider info).
* IPC Protocol: Messages mirroring the repo's RPC request/response types (`op = init|step|snapshot|stop`, returning ticks and/or snapshots).

## 4) Modules and Responsibilities

* Main Window
  Orchestrates actions, holds global timers, and manages panel layout persistence.
* Engine Client
  Lives on a worker thread, owns the sidecar process/socket, sends JSON messages, parses replies, and emits Qt signals for lifecycle, ticks, and snapshots.
* Snapshot Buffer
  Ring buffers for time-series metrics and a last-value cache for full state; supports downsampling and rolling windows.
* Metrics Panel
  Plots population, energy mean, and S/I/R time-series from `SimulationMetrics`. Optional spatial metrics (density, clustering) use presence checks.
* World View
  2-D map rendering agents (position, SIR state, energy) and an environment heatmap derived from the resource grid.
* Config Panel
  Edit a minimal, safe subset of `EngineConfigV1`; reset to defaults using the engine's default configuration shape. Validation mirrors engine constraints.
* Event Log
  Displays engine lifecycle events and errors.

## 5) Data Contracts (as used by the GUI)

* Configuration (input): `EngineConfigV1` with simulation, agents, disease, environment, and RNG sections; defaults are available in the engine for bootstrapping forms.
* Metrics snapshot (frequent): `SimulationMetrics` containing `pop`, `energyMean`, `sir{S,I,R}`, optional `ageDist`, optional `spatial`.
* Full snapshot (occasional): same plus `state.agents[]` and `state.environment` (resource grid, tick, optional weather).
* Provider info (optional overlay): provider name/version/license.

## 6) IPC and Concurrency Model

* Threading
  UI thread for rendering; Engine Client on worker thread; a UI timer (10‚Äì20 Hz) to throttle chart and map updates.
* Call cadence
  Batched `step(n)` calls; request a metrics snapshot after every batch; request a full snapshot every M batches (tunable).
* Error handling
  Any sidecar error turns off "Run" state, shows a toast/log entry, and re-enables "Start".

## 7) User Interface Layout and Interactions

* Top Toolbar
  Provider selector; Start, Run, Step√ó1/10/100, Stop; snapshot cadence selector; progress bar reflecting current tick.
* Left Dock (Config)
  Editable subset: population size, world size, max steps, disease toggles and rates (0‚Äì1), reproduction/environment toggles, movement speed and energy ranges, RNG seed and stream toggles; Load/Save JSON; Reset Defaults.
* Center (World View)
  2-D map of agents; heatmap overlay for resources; mouse wheel zoom, drag pan; "follow agent" mode (highest energy or oldest).
* Right Dock (Metrics)
  Three single-purpose charts: Population vs. Tick and Energy Mean vs. Tick; S/I/R vs. Tick; optional Spatial metrics vs. Tick.
* Bottom Dock (Event Log)
  Lifecycle messages: starting, stepped, snapshotting, completed, stopped, error. The engine emits these phases internally; surface them as log entries.

## 8) Rendering Details (World View)

* Coordinate system
  Map simulation `[0..worldSize]` for both axes to scene coordinates. World size is configured in simulation.
* Agents
  Draw as circles in a single batched paint operation; colour by SIR class; radius modestly scaled by energy (clamped).
* Heatmap
  Rebuild `QImage` from `environment.resourceGrid` on full snapshots only; normalize grid, apply a lightweight LUT, and cache between paints.
* Performance
  Avoid one-item-per-agent; use a single painter with a tight loop; disable expensive antialiasing if necessary.

## 9) Metrics Handling and Charting Strategy

* Data retention
  Keep a rolling window (e.g., last 10k ticks). Older points are trimmed.
* Downsampling
  Plot every k-th point when data gets dense; adjust k dynamically to maintain repaint budgets.
* Update cadence
  UI timer pulls the newest metrics set; charts update at 10‚Äì20 FPS independent of simulator speed.

## 10) Validation and Safety

* Mirror engine checks before sending `init`: positive sizes, 0‚Äì1 disease rates, min ‚â§ max for ranges, etc. The engine's `validateConfiguration` performs similar checks; catch issues early in the GUI with inline hints.
* Disable conflicting actions (e.g., Start while running).
* Confirm Stop if there are unsaved results.

## 11) Configuration Storage and Profiles

* JSON import/export exactly matches `EngineConfigV1`.
* Presets: "Default", "Dense world", "High transmission", "No disease", etc.
* Persist last-used config and window layout per user on local disk.

## 12) Performance Plan and Targets

* Metrics snapshots every 5‚Äì10 steps; full snapshots every 50‚Äì100 steps (tunable).
* Rendering capped to ‚â§30 FPS to keep CPU headroom.
* Target: smooth UI with ‚â•1k agents on typical laptop iGPU; charts responsive with large time windows.

## 13) Error Handling and Diagnostics

* Sidecar lifecycle: show status (Starting, Running, Stopped, Error) in status bar and Event Log.
* On parse or protocol errors, display a concise message and attach last JSON payload in a collapsible details view.
* Provide a "Copy diagnostics" button to gather app logs, last request/response, and platform info.

## 14) Build, Run, and Packaging

* Build system: CMake + Qt 6 for the GUI; Node project for the sidecar.
* Dev workflow: run the GUI with paths to `node` and the sidecar script configurable in settings.
* Packaging:

  * Windows: `windeployqt`, ship Node runtime and sidecar inside app folder.
  * macOS: `macdeployqt` inside `.app`, Node in `Resources`.
  * Linux: AppImage/Flatpak; confirm Node availability or bundle it.

## 15) Security and Privacy

* The sidecar listens only on stdio by default; if using TCP, bind to `localhost` and random high port; no external exposure.
* Do not log full agent states by default; metrics logging only unless user opts in.
* Config files stored in user data directory; include a privacy note in settings.

## 16) Accessibility and UX Quality

* Keyboard shortcuts for all critical actions (e.g., Space to toggle Run, R to reset, +/- to zoom).
* High-contrast colour scheme option; colour-blind friendly palette for S/I/R.
* Scalable fonts and DPI-aware rendering.

## 17) Internationalization (Optional, v2)

* Wrap all strings with translation macros; load `.qm` files at startup.
* Ensure numeric inputs respect locale while serializing JSON in canonical form.

## 18) Telemetry (Optional, opt-in)

* Anonymous performance counters (FPS, buffer sizes).
* Strict opt-in, no personal data, easy toggle in settings.

## 19) Testing Strategy

* Unit tests (GUI-less): JSON parsing and validation, Snapshot Buffer trimming/downsampling, coordinate transforms, colour map correctness.
* Integration tests: launch sidecar, perform `init ‚Üí step ‚Üí snapshot ‚Üí stop` sequences, assert timing and data invariants; simulate malformed replies.
* Performance tests: long-run stepping (e.g., 50k ticks) to ensure no leaks and stable FPS.
* Determinism checks (optional): compare RNG/sim digests from snapshots to spot regressions; these fields are present in snapshot metadata.

## 20) Milestones and Deliverables

* Sprint 1 ‚Äî Foundations
  Shell app, Engine Client (start/stop, send/receive), Config Panel with minimal fields and validation, Event Log.
* Sprint 2 ‚Äî Metrics First
  Snapshot Buffer, Metrics Panel (Population, Energy, S/I/R), batched stepping loop, progress bar, basic error handling.
* Sprint 3 ‚Äî World View
  Full snapshot ingestion, heatmap renderer, batched agent painter, zoom/pan, follow-agent mode.
* Sprint 4 ‚Äî Polish & Release
  Presets and JSON profiles, provider picker and info overlay, layout persistence, packaging scripts, smoke tests on Windows/macOS/Linux.

## 21) Acceptance Criteria (MVP)

* Start/Run/Step/Stop flows work against the sidecar without UI freezes.
* Charts update smoothly with a rolling window at ‚â•10 FPS while stepping.
* World View renders ‚â•1k agents and environment heatmap at ‚â•20 FPS on a typical laptop.
* Error conditions recover to a clean idle state; user can restart without relaunching the app.
* JSON config round-trips exactly to the engine's schema.

## 22) Risks and Mitigations

* IPC back-pressure under very high step rates: mitigate with batched steps, snapshot throttling, and bounded buffers.
* Large agent counts causing render stalls: mitigate with batched painting, optional downsampling, and capped FPS.
* Cross-platform packaging complexity: invest early in CI scripts and test signed builds on all targets.

## 23) Future Enhancements (Post-MVP)

* 3-D world via Qt Quick 3D with interchangeable rendering back-ends.
* Replay mode from recorded snapshots; export to MP4/GIF.
* Script console to adjust parameters during a run.
* Multi-provider comparison runs with overlaid metrics.
* Remote-control headless engine on a server via authenticated WebSocket.

## 24) Documentation Plan

* "Getting Started" with screenshots and a 60-second quick-run guide.
* "Configuration Reference" mapping every GUI field to `EngineConfigV1`.
* "Troubleshooting & Diagnostics" with common IPC errors and remedies.
* "Extending the GUI" covering how to add panels or swap the world renderer.

### Why this outline matches your code today

* It relies only on engine capabilities already present: lifecycle controls, default config factory, typed snapshots (metrics/full), and provider metadata.
* It treats the GUI as a thin, resilient client that can evolve independently of the Node/TS engine and its providers.
